# Adaptive Tree-based Video Representation for LLM Reasoning

This project provides a framework for processing long videos by:
1. Extracting hierarchical representations using CLIP features
2. Building adaptive tree structures based on visual and temporal similarity
3. Enabling LLM reasoning through summarization and Q&A

## Features

- Video processing with frame extraction and feature embedding
- Hierarchical tree construction
- Integration with LLMs (OpenAI GPT, LLaMA)
- Web interface for video upload and interaction

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/video-llm-reasoning.git
   cd video-llm-reasoning
